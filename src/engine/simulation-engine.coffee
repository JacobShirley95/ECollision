            #
            #              let diffVelocityX = particle2_velocityX-particle1_velocityX
            #              let diffVelocityY = particle2_velocityY-particle1_velocityY

            #              let particle2_yFinal = particle2_currentY - (particle2_velocityY * time)
            #
            #          We need to solve for time:
            #              let diffX = particle2_xFinal-particle1_xFinal
            #              let diffY = particle2_yFinal-particle1_yFinal
            #
            #          Rearranging and subbing-in this gives:
            #              diffX = particle2_currentX - (particle2_velocityX * time) - particle1_currentX - (particle1_velocityX * time) 
            #                    = (particle2_currentX - particle1_currentX) - time*(particle2_velocityX-particle1_velocityX)

            #                    = dy - time*diffVelocityY          
            #
            #          Now it is just like a collision check, as above, except this time we can solve for time:

            #                      = sqr(dx - time*diffVelocityX) + sqr(dy - time*diffVelocityY)
            #
            #          Now to expand the brackets:
            #              sqr = sqr(dx) - 2*time*diffVelocityX*dx + sqr(time)*sqr(diffVelocityX) + sqr(dy) - 2*time*diffVelocityY*dy + sqr(time)*sqr(diffVelocityY)

            #          So our quadratic equation is:
            #              let radiiSqred = sqr(particle1_radius+particle2_radius)
            #
            #              sqr = a*sqr(time) + b*time + c-radiiSqred = 0
